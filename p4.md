## Executive Summary
Bike YYC is an app that allows users to view, follow, and create routes in and around Calgary. It is aimed mainly towards bike enthusiasts of all kinds, but is meant to be used by anyone who enjoys fitness and/or adventure and who want to explore the city of Calgary while documenting and sharing their experience. This app was designed following a user centered iterative process in order to capture the needs and goals of potential users and stakeholders.


## Introduction
Our method of designing the application Bike YYC consisted of triangulating on user needs by conducting interviews, creating character profiles and researching and comparing the current options on the market. We used this information to create several base ideas of application design, features and decisions about the final function of the application. These ideas were then refined, critiqued and refined again in a trial of lo-fi prototypes and brainstorming, with the final product being the hifi, fairly broad prototype of our final design of Bike YYC. 


## Design Problem
The problem is that there are no biking apps available that allow users to create custom routes in Calgary and the surrounding area. Current sources of bike trails are mainly provided on the City of Calgary’s website and a few others, which provide very little, outdated, mundane information. Moreover, these sources are not mobile friendly and have no interactivity, which does not help the user who wants to follow a trail while biking or walking. Bike YYC aims to address all these issues and provide an app that is easy to use, flexible and customizable, offering the user a range of functionality. 

## User Research and Findings
User research was conducted using 3 main methods: Secondary Research, Interviews, and Character Profiles. Secondary research was chosen since it reflected what a typical user would experience and what they were looking for in a service similar to ours. Interviews were chosen since they are able to give a specific insight into someone who currently is dealing with the problem and what they would be looking for in our services/solution to the problem. Character profiles were chosen to capture someone who would use our service and to be able to get more specific insight into the types of people who would use our service.

The above methods all complement each other in that the secondary research helped us identify who our target audience is and where we can find them in order to conduct the interviews, as well as the current applications available and their shortcomings, which we would aim to avoid. The interviews then allowed us a broad look at the user base, bikers both prospective and current, and to get their personal insight in the issue. Finally, Character Profiles took an in depth look at the needs and wants of potential users, to a degree that would be awkward or difficult in passing interviews.

One interesting finding from conducting secondary research was that the main goal of those users was primarily fitness, rather than just leisure or route discovery. This could be caused by the fact that current apps do not allow for a more “social” form of trail sharing (pictures, reviews, ratings, etc.), which means that our app may be more appealing to a broader set of users.
 
Our findings from conducting interviews and building character profiles was very useful in determining what pitfalls to avoid while designing our application, and what things users are looking to find out with a tool such as ours, and in general when it comes to mobile applications.



## Design and Justification
We have added a few functionalities that were added based on the findings from the user research phase. The most important are highlighted below. 

### Add Route

Add Route is a functionality that is original and does not exist in any other form of technology for bikers. It has served as the starting point for our team in further improving and designing the app. 

The menu button the main screen opens up a tab from the left that allows you to do multiple things. The primary feature is add route, denoted by a plus sign, which conforms to the convention of “adding more”. Furthermore, it is displayed beside “My Routes” making is clearer to the user that it will possibly ”Add something to My Routes”.  This function can be accomplished in three options: dropping pins on the map, tracing a route onto the screen, or starting the GPS to track the phone’s location and create a route from it. 

Some of the design choices that we made were based on similar design ideas across various apps. For example the map, and the dropping of pins onto the map, are laid out similarly to Google’s Maps app, to aim for positive transfer in users. 


### My route, routes near me, popular route

This function of the app is highlighted because it represents one of the core functionalities that the app will have. This includes the ability to view your saved/created routes, view the routes in a certain area, and the popular routes around you. All three functions can be accessed via the menu button on the main screen. 

The “My Routes” button allows you to view your created and saved routes in as a list, a future feature would be a sorting and searching feature, which would make searching routes easier. 
Once a route is selected for viewing, its details will be displayed. These include the name, a description, some pictures of the route, a difficulty, a rating based on people's reviews, and an option to view the reviews or add one yourself. There is also a “Start Route” option which will start a gps system from the start of the trail, you can then follow the gps trail and earn points for the route. 

The “Routes around me” functionality allows the user to view the routes around them or in a certain area. The routes will be displayed on a map and the routes’ starting points will be labeled as pins on the map. The user can then touch the pins and view the route details, as well as add the route to their “My Routes” list. 

The “Popular Routes” option gives the user the ability to view the most popular routes that are in the database. These are presented in a list fashion with the ratings emphasized. The user can then select a route and view their details, or add it to their “My Routes” list. 

Some of the design choices were added so that they would be straightforward and easy to understand. The design of the “Popular Routes” screen and the “My Routes” screen were based on similar apps, such as bike exercising apps. Each of the functions are presented in a neat and simple, but also intuitive fashion. Such as “Routes near me” displaying a map dotted with pins, representing the nearby routes visually in the same physical space as the user, which can be simply interacted with. 

### Settings

The settings function of the app is the third functionality highlighted. It’s where the user can edit his/her profile, adjust and view privacy options, modify notification settings, send feedback, and view terms and policy. 

The settings page can be accessed by pressing on the menu and then selecting the “gear” icon on the top left corner. The “edit profile” setting enables the user to edit his/her name, add email (optional), add phone number (optional), and provide a personal statement describing who they are (optional). The user can also either take/add/remove profile picture. 

The “privacy” setting enables the user to block other users, adjust availability, view privacy policy, etc. The “notification” setting enables the user to adjust sound, vibration, and other features. 

The “send feedback” option enables the user to rate the app on either Google Play or the App Store, and send a message to the developers. 

The “help center” option, although not implemented, is where the user can find documentation and videos on how to use the app.

Finally, the settings page includes “terms and conditions” to display the terms of using the app. 

The design choices used here were based on the idea that the user should have many options available to them, but not too many at once. Options such as editing the profile were put as sub options under the “Edit profile” button, because it allows an easier way of seeing all the available options for that category. 

Overall for the design layout, the idea of following general conventions was mainly used. Keeping it simple and intuitive was another factor and it contributed to large buttons with not much text or intricate details on them. 

## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings
Our collective Heuristic Evaluations of the system uncovered several holes where work would be needed to improve the application. 


### Add Routes via Pins Functionality
The first issue that needs to be looked at is the Route Addition, since it is a major feature of our system, and to have it working effectively is a top priority for our application. There are several individual heuristics violated with the current design of the pin add functionality, which we will cover in one category. 

When adding pins to the route, the user's control is somewhat limited with regards to being able to edit and control what they put down after that initial click to place down a pin. Effectively they are locked into the choices they make and need to undo the entire route to make any changes in the case of an error, since the only option to undo clears all. 

There is also no way to edit the pins after they have been placed, to drag them over to another street if they misclicked at some point in the past. 

Finally, the feedback given by the application currently is not sufficient, as the route that the algorithm might decide on may not snap to the correct roads that the user meant for them to snap to. 

The fixes for this feature would be as simple as adding a feature that would allow single step undos as well as retaining the total clear function, with the current design choice to be clicking for single step undos, and pressing and holding for a full clear with the prompts still asking if the user indeed wants to undo their work. 

Second, if the pins were interactive after being dropped, by a short click and hold to unlock the ability to drag them about the map after being placed, that would solve the issue of not being able to make slight variations to your route without having to undo more than you need to. 

Finally, if the red dotted line was updated in real time with information to the user, that would solve the issue of Visibility of System Status, and allow for the user to see how their choices will resolve every step of the way.


### Error notification system
Another severe Heuristic violated we found in our evaluations would be the lack of any sort of error notification system in place over the entire application. When the application fails to upload, or a user interacts with the system in an unexpected way and breaks it, there is no currently designed system for informing the user of the problem. 

The fix for this violation would be to design simple popup messages with pre-written text for larger errors (such as “image failed to upload” or “Maps cannot contact the server”) that might happen more often, or are ‘expected’ or more mundane errors. 

For more in depth system errors or glitches that force an application crash, or trap the user into a corner they can’t back out of, an ever present ‘report error’ button at the bottom (automatically clicked on application crash) will bring up a final error popup. This will ask for permission to send their session data along with the type of error, and any feedback the user wishes to give, up to the server where we will be able to try and look into, and prevent that same type of error of happening in the future.


### Add route via GPS Logging Functionality

The last violation we found that we will be taking a closer look into would be the GPS logging feature of the applications lack of any Error Prevention in regards to the user forgetting they even began logging, resulting in a long and useless trail logged overall that the user likely did not want to log. This also raises a problem about wasting battery life that will likely be a major issue with users, if such a mistake is common.

The fix for this violation would be to implement a sort of notification, either through audio alerts to the user, or through vibrations, to remind them that the GPS functionality is currently running. This would cut down on the amount of times users may forget about the route logging, but it would not eliminate it entirely in the case that the user has the phone muted, and silenced its vibrations, or the phone is placed down and not looked at for a time. 

Adding a timeout function which will automatically stop logging if no movements are detected for over 15 minutes will help solve the latter case and prevent overly wasteful power drain. For the former case, allowing the user to edit the trail after the fact, and cut out unwanted sections of mistakenly logged route is another potential fix. 


## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design

There are many features and functionalities that we can add, as well as fix up some of the current designs and functionalities, a few of them are listed below. 

One major recommendation is to include the functionalities designed for nearby cities and towns. Since it is common practice in Calgary to go out hiking or camping, users might find it beneficial that they can create or find trails outside the city. Places such as Banff and Lake Louise are known to have beautiful sceneries and vast unexplored, undocumented areas to create a trail for and share with others. In addition, extending the range of the app outside Calgary will help attract more users, including residents of such towns, thereby increasing user database and app recognition.

## Conclusion
Bike YYC is an app that was designed iteratively while focusing on the user’s needs. It provides a solution to a widely agreed upon issue among several cyclists in the city of Calgary - the lack of any apps that are able to provide up to date, descriptive, and useful information regarding bike trails in the city that one can view, follow, create and share among other users.

The general process of designing the app included conducting user research, generating ideas, building prototypes, and finally evaluating the system. Throughout the design process several methods were utilized, ideas generated, and phases repeated, giving rise to a wide range of more useful functionalities that can be implemented. 

In the end, not all functionalities could be incorporated due to the common design trade-offs such as technical constraints, commercial feasibility, and available resources. As a result, the design never reached the final phase of production.

Nevertheless, the progress made so far by the team to find an answer for an enduring question has been satisfying and very educational, and can perhaps serve as a platform from which further design iterations can continue. And perhaps in that regard, it has been an achievement.
