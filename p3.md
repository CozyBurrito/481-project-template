[BIKE YYC APP PROTOTYPE](http://5b39g5.axshare.com/)

## Highlight Walkthrough

    Add Route

![](http://i.imgur.com/JUi1rIy.gif) 

The first feature we will be conducting a walkthrough of will be the addition of routes to the application: 

Jeremy Smith has been biking around his community for a long time, and just got a bike mount for his smart phone, and wants to start logging his routes for posterity. He will open up our app wherever he wants, and will see the main menu as shown.

Clicking the menu button, he will quickly notice the prominent My Routes tab at the top, as well as the plus sign which he will select to add routes. Opting to outline a route with pins, Jeremy begins sliding the map over to his location, but rethinks things, and searches for his house, and then begins pinning out a familiar route he takes down to the river valley and back. 

Once he finishes outlining the pinned route, he will hit the checkmark, confirm, and be taken to the route selection screen, where he will fill it out with a name, a few tags so he can find it easier, and his own estimation of its difficulty, but he chooses not to describe it as he already knows the route well, and doesn't take the sharing aspect of the application seriously enough to bother. It will look as shown here:

Later on while using the app, Jeremy will begin to use the automatic logging feature with GPS mounted to his bike as he travels around the city as a quick and easy way to map out his many trails.


    My Route, Routes near me, Popular route

This function of the app is highlighted because it represents one of the core functionalities that the app will have. This includes the ability to view your saved/created routes, view the routes in a certain area, and the popular routes around you. All three functions can be accessed via the menu button on the main screen. 
 
The “My Routes” button allows you to view your created and saved routes in as a list, a future feature would be a sorting and searching feature, which would make searching routes easier. 
Once a route is selected for viewing, its details will be displayed. These include the name, a description, some pictures of the route, a difficulty, a rating based on people's reviews, and an option to view the reviews or add one yourself. There is also a “Start Route” option which will start a gps system from the start of the trail, you can then follow the gps trail and earn points for the route. 
 
The “Routes around me” functionality allows the user to view the routes around them or in a certain area. The routes will be displayed on a map and the routes’ starting points will be labeled as pins on the map. The user can then touch the pins and view the route details, as well as add the route to their “My Routes” list. 
 
The “Popular Routes” option gives the user the ability to view the most popular routes that are in the database. These are presented in a list fashion with the ratings emphasized. The user can then select a route and view their details, or add it to their “My Routes” list. 

 
 
    Settings

The settings function of the app is the third task highlighted on the prototype. It is where the user can edit his/her profile, adjust and view privacy options, modify notification settings, send feedback, and view terms and policy. 

The settings page can be accessed by pressing on the menu and then selecting the “gear” icon on the top left corner. The “edit profile” setting enables the user to edit his/her name, add email (optional), add phone number (optional), and provide a personal statement describing who they are (optional). The user can also either take/add/remove profile picture.

The “privacy” setting enables the user to block other users, adjust availability, view privacy policy, etc. The “notification” setting enables the user to adjust sound, vibration, and other features. 

The “send feedback” option enables the user to rate the app on either Google Play or the App Store, and send a message to the developers. The “help center” option, although not implemented, is where the user can find documentation and videos on how to use the app. 

Finally, the settings page includes “terms and conditions” to display the terms of using the app. 


## Heuristic Evaluation Results

Our collective Heuristic Evaluations of the system uncovered several holes where work would be needed to improve the application. Our raw evaluations can be found below, but an in depth look at the most severe problems will be conducted here.

The first issue that needs to be looked at is the Route Addition, since it is a major feature of our system, and to have it working effectively is a top priority for our application. There are several individual heuristics violated with the current design of the pin add functionality, which we will cover in one category. 

When adding pins to the route, the Users control is somewhat limited with regards to being able to edit and control what they put down after that initial click to place down a pin. Effectively they are locked into the choices they make and need to undo the entire route to make any changes in the case of an error, since the only option to undo clears all. There is also no way to edit the pins after they have been placed, to drag them over to another street if they misclicked at some point in the past. Finally, the feedback given by the application currently is not sufficient, as the route that the algorithm might decide on may not snap to the correct roads that the user meant for them to snap to. 

The fixes for this feature would be as simple as adding a feature that would allow single step undos as well as retaining the total clear function, with the current design choice to be clicking for single step undos, and pressing and holding for a full clear with the prompts still asking if the user indeed wants to undo their work. Second, if the pins were interactive after being dropped, by a short click and hold to unlock the ability to drag them about the map after being placed, that would solve the issue of not being able to make slight variations to your route without having to undo more than you need to. Finally, if the red dotted line was updated in real time with information to the user, that would solve the issue of Visibility of System Status, and allow for the user to see how their choices will resolve every step of the way.

Another severe Heuristic violated we found in our evaluations would be the lack of any sort of error notification system in place over the entire application. When the application fails to upload, or a user interacts with the system in an unexpected way and breaks it, there is no currently designed system for informing the user of the problem. 

The fix for this violation would be to design simple popup messages with pre-written text for larger errors (such as “image failed to upload” or “Maps cannot contact the server”) that might happen more often, or are ‘expected’ or more mundane errors. For more in depth system errors or glitches that force an application crash, or trap the user into a corner they can’t back out of, an ever present ‘report error’ button at the bottom (automatically clicked on application crash) will bring up a final error popup. This will ask for permission to send their session data along with the type of error, and any feedback the user wishes to give, up to the server where we will be able to try and look into, and prevent that same type of error of happening in the future.
 
The last violation we found that we will be taking a closer look into would be the GPS logging feature of the applications lack of any Error Prevention in regards to the user forgetting they even began logging, resulting in a long and useless trail logged overall that the user likely did not want to log. This also raises a problem about wasting battery life that will likely be a major issue with users, if such a mistake is common.

The fix for this violation would be to implement a sort of notification, either through audio alerts to the user, or through vibrations, to remind them that the GPS functionality is currently running. This would cut down on the amount of times users may forget about the route logging, but it would not eliminate it entirely in the case that the user has the phone muted, and silenced its vibrations, or the phone is placed down and not looked at for a time. Adding a timeout function which will automatically stop logging if no movements are detected for over 15 minutes will help solve the latter case and prevent overly wasteful power drain. For the former case, allowing the user to edit the trail after the fact, and cut out unwanted sections of mistakenly logged route is another potential fix.
