## Highlight Walkthrough

### Add Route 

![](http://i.imgur.com/JUi1rIy.gif) 

The first feature we will be conducting a walkthrough of will be the addition of routes to the application: 

Jeremy Smith has been biking around his community for a long time, and just got a bike mount for his smart phone, and wants to start logging his routes for posterity. He will open up our app wherever he wants, and will see the main menu as shown.

Clicking the menu button, he will quickly notice the prominent My Routes tab at the top, as well as the plus sign which he will select to add routes. Opting to outline a route with pins, Jeremy begins sliding the map over to his location, but rethinks things, and searches for his house, and then begins pinning out a familiar route he takes down to the river valley and back. 

Once he finishes outlining the pinned route, he will hit the checkmark, confirm, and be taken to the route selection screen, where he will fill it out with a name, a few tags so he can find it easier, and his own estimation of its difficulty, but he chooses not to describe it as he already knows the route well, and doesn't take the sharing aspect of the application seriously enough to bother. It will look as shown here:

Later on while using the app, Jeremy will begin to use the automatic logging feature with GPS mounted to his bike as he travels around the city as a quick and easy way to map out his many trails.

### Settings

The settings function of the app is the third task highlighted on the prototype. It is where the user can edit his/her profile, adjust and view privacy options, modify notification settings, send feedback, and view terms and policy. 

The settings page can be accessed by pressing on the menu and then selecting the “gear” icon on the top left corner. The “edit profile” setting enables the user to edit his/her name, add email (optional), add phone number (optional), and provide a personal statement describing who they are (optional). The user can also either take/add/remove profile picture.

The “privacy” setting enables the user to block other users, adjust availability, view privacy policy, etc. The “notification” setting enables the user to adjust sound, vibration, and other features. 

The “send feedback” option enables the user to rate the app on either Google Play or the App Store, and send a message to the developers. The “help center” option, although not implemented, is where the user can find documentation and videos on how to use the app. 

Finally, the settings page includes “terms and conditions” to display the terms of using the app. 

## Heuristic Evaluation Results

Which heuristics should we include here? I think 3 each would be enough for a combined evaluation. 
 
## Raw Heuristic Evaluation notes
 
The table below shows the individual heuristic evaluations of the ‘Bike YYC’ app by the team.
