## Video Prototype

Our Video concerns the task of adding a new route to the app, and goes over three different methods from our brainstorming session on how to accomplish that(Dragging and dropping pins to outline a map, using your finger to draw a map out, and using GPS to log a route). The task then concerns how the naming and detailing of a finished route is handled, using a screen where a user can type in a name, a description, give it a difficulty and tags so other users can easily find it. When they are happy with this route, they may accept, and it is uploaded.
 
 
## Storyboard

The process follows the creation and addition of a route to a person's account.
First the user presses the menu button, then presses a “plus sign” to add a new route to their routes. Then, they pan into their area of interest and either tap to add pins onto the map, or trace out their route outline. They can also be able to edit their route upon creation by removing pins or redrawing their route. Next, they press the green checkmark to confirm creation of the new route, after which they enter in the route details, which includes the name, a description, the difficulty, and possibly images. Finally they are taken back to the main screen where a green status bar confirms that their route was successfully added.

### Affinity Diagrams
 
The affinity diagrams consisted of 4 groups out of which 3 were selected. Detailed information provided below.

### Add route functionality
 
![](http://i.imgur.com/dFiPSqTm.jpg?1)
 
The add route function is the primary purpose of the app and can be accomplished in three different ways.
 
Once the user is signed in or in guest mode, the add route function can be accessed from the main menu located on the top left. When selected, this will bring up a map of Calgary and a search bar. The user can then select his/her area of interest by typing in the location, or by swiping around until desired location is identified, or by pressing the GPS icon at the bottom right, which will pan to the user’s current location.
 
Afterwards, the user is prompted to select one of the three methods of adding a route: Drop pins, Trace route, GPS tracking.
 
The drop pins method allows the user to add routes by dropping pins on the map until a trail can be formed once an area is selected; whereas the traceroute method allows for the same functionality, but by physically tracing a route by finger. The GPS tracking method, on the other hand, uses the phone’s GPS system to create a route real-time by tracing the route outline as the user is biking.

After a route has been created, the user can save the information by clicking the “tick” button on the bottom right of the page or cancel by clicking “X”. If the user approves and decides to save the newly created route, a route details page is displayed prompting the user to enter a name for the route, location, and a brief description.
 
![](http://i.imgur.com/8mDcJD4m.jpg?1)
 
Once the user selects to save the information, a confirmation window is displayed, prompting the user to approve or decline requested operation.
 
The user will also have the option of posting pictures to the description, setting difficulty level, and publishing route to other app users or sharing with specific friends. Once shared, other users will be able to see route, add comments and provide rating if desired. 
 
The add route functionality was the first idea that was proposed as a solution to design problems that currently exist with other similar apps. It is presently a functionality that is original and does not exist in any other form of technology for bikers. It has served as the starting point for our team in further improving and designing the app. Furthermore, we have validated the need for such functionality during the investigation phase of our design by conducting user research such as interviews and character profiles. Implementing this functionality is feasible as the technology required to perform the operation is already available. One possible area of weakness in realizing this functionality is a way of distinguishing between swiping for search and swiping for tracing route when using the second method of adding a route. However, our team has been able to identify a few possible solutions such as, pressing and holding on map for a few seconds before activating trace route, or tapping twice, or perhaps even adding a separate button to activate method.
 
 
### Route search functionality
 
![](http://i.imgur.com/XmNRjD1.jpg)
 
A search bar is visible on the main screen, and when typed into, it displays search results.
It would allow results for both a location, if one was entered, and for trails with that search string.
 
In the example, the string “Downtown” was entered into the search bar. It then displays an option for the downtown location, and if selected it would take you back to the map view but more specifically the downtown area. 
The other results consist of trails/paths relevant to the search string (for example “Downtown”). These would include a picture, the name of the trail, a rating, the primary location, and the difficulty.

Once a trail is selected from the results, it will take you to a details screen, this screen also includes the main picture, but also allows you to see other pictures that may be present. It also includes the name, rating, location, and difficulty, but it also has a button to look at reviews, and a picture of the route on a map, where the trail is highlighted and has pins for the start and end locations. This map would be intractable. There is also a checkmark button, allowing the user to start the trail. There is a plus button as well, which would allow the user to add the route to their list of routes (Primarily for quicker/easier access in the future). 
 
The design and flow of the search and route details was based on feedback from our previous research. It was noted that many people liked the designs that were being used in similar apps, and did not care for finer options, but rather quick and efficient access to the routes. The styles also conform to common designs, allowing new users to easily adapt to the design, and minimizing negative transfer feedback.
