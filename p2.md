## Video Prototype
 
Please see the Slack Channel for the Video Prototype Powerpoint File
 
[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJIKoUX56T0)

Our Video concerns the task of adding a new route to the app, and goes over three different methods from our brainstorming session on how to accomplish that(Dragging and dropping pins to outline a map, using your finger to draw a map out, and using GPS to log a route). The task then concerns how the naming and detailing of a finished route is handled, using a screen where a user can type in a name, a description, give it a difficulty and tags so other users can easily find it. When they are happy with this route, they may accept, and it is uploaded.
 
 
## Storyboard

The process follows the creation and addition of a route to a person's account.
First the user presses the menu button, then presses a “plus sign” to add a new route to their routes. Then, they pan into their area of interest and either tap to add pins onto the map, or trace out their route outline. They can also be able to edit their route upon creation by removing pins or redrawing their route. Next, they press the green checkmark to confirm creation of the new route, after which they enter in the route details, which includes the name, a description, the difficulty, and possibly images. Finally they are taken back to the main screen where a green status bar confirms that their route was successfully added.
 
## Task-Centered System Walkthrough
Lincoln is a 28-year-old tourist guide in Calgary. Some of his tours include bike rides around the city with a group of people. As an avid cyclist, Lincoln has discovered a few bike paths that provide shortcuts, as well as beautiful sceneries, which are unbeknown to many of his colleagues. Lincoln would like to find out how he can record this information and how he can share it not only with his colleagues, but also his tour group and others. Lincoln would also like to receive feedback from the users of his trail about their experience.

Lincoln discovers the BikeYYC app and decides to try it out on his next cycling tour. 

| Task Step											| Knowledeable? Motivated? Believable | Comments/Suggested fixes                                                                                                                                                                                                      	|
|-------											|----------------					  |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Opens app											| Yes. Yes. Yes.   					  | Straight forward. User should be able to accomplish this task without any difficutly.                                                             	|
| Select "add route" from menu	 					| Yes. Yes. Yes.         			  | All possible app functions accessed through menu; menu bar consistent with other app designs and conforms to standard. Menu bar could flash upon entering app to indicate next step.                                                                   	|
| Select GPS method for adding route			   	| Maybe. Yes. Yes.         			  | User is prompted to select one of three options upon selecting "add route"; options include icons for clarity; all options common in a standard map app except for "trace", but made clear through icon. If user has used any kind of map technology before, he will be knowledgeable          	|
| Accept trail created    							| Yes. Yes. Yes.   					  | Only two options available upon route creation: "approve" or "cancel". Similarly a straight forward action.  	|
| Enter route information and tag friends			| Yes. Yes. Yes. 					  | Involves filling out a short form to give route a "name", "description", "difficulty level" with the option of uploading pictures. This is also straight forward; a way for user to identify his routes. "tag friends" option could be more descriptive or include icon or perhaps be an option after saving route.                               	|
| Save route details and close app    				| Yes. Yes. Yes.   					  | Upon entering route details user only has option of editing his information, going back or saving informtation. This would be a clear step.  	|

### Add route functionality
 
![](http://i.imgur.com/dFiPSqTm.jpg?1)
 
The add route function is the primary purpose of the app and can be accomplished in three different ways.
 
Once the user is signed in or in guest mode, the add route function can be accessed from the main menu located on the top left. When selected, this will bring up a map of Calgary and a search bar. The user can then select his/her area of interest by typing in the location, or by swiping around until desired location is identified, or by pressing the GPS icon at the bottom right, which will pan to the user’s current location.
 
Afterwards, the user is prompted to select one of the three methods of adding a route: Drop pins, Trace route, GPS tracking.
 
The drop pins method allows the user to add routes by dropping pins on the map until a trail can be formed once an area is selected; whereas the traceroute method allows for the same functionality, but by physically tracing a route by finger. The GPS tracking method, on the other hand, uses the phone’s GPS system to create a route real-time by tracing the route outline as the user is biking.
 
![](http://i.imgur.com/MFTf2tzm.jpg)
 
After a route has been created, the user can save the information by clicking the “tick” button on the bottom right of the page or cancel by clicking “X”. If the user approves and decides to save the newly created route, a route details page is displayed prompting the user to enter a name for the route, location, and a brief description.
 
![](http://i.imgur.com/8mDcJD4m.jpg?1)
 
Once the user selects to save the information, a confirmation window is displayed, prompting the user to approve or decline requested operation.
 
The user will also have the option of posting pictures to the description, setting difficulty level, and publishing route to other app users or sharing with specific friends. Once shared, other users will be able to see route, add comments and provide rating if desired. 
 
The add route functionality was the first idea that was proposed as a solution to design problems that currently exist with other similar apps. It is presently a functionality that is original and does not exist in any other form of technology for bikers. It has served as the starting point for our team in further improving and designing the app. Furthermore, we have validated the need for such functionality during the investigation phase of our design by conducting user research such as interviews and character profiles. Implementing this functionality is feasible as the technology required to perform the operation is already available. One possible area of weakness in realizing this functionality is a way of distinguishing between swiping for search and swiping for tracing route when using the second method of adding a route. However, our team has been able to identify a few possible solutions such as, pressing and holding on map for a few seconds before activating trace route, or tapping twice, or perhaps even adding a separate button to activate method.
 
 
### Route search functionality
 
![](http://i.imgur.com/kRaHUYXm.jpg?1)
 
A search bar is visible on the main screen, and when typed into, it displays search results.
It would allow results for both a location, if one was entered, and for trails with that search string.
 
In the example, the string “Downtown” was entered into the search bar. It then displays an option for the downtown location, and if selected it would take you back to the map view but more specifically the downtown area. 
The other results consist of trails/paths relevant to the search string (for example “Downtown”). These would include a picture, the name of the trail, a rating, the primary location, and the difficulty.
 
![](http://i.imgur.com/8mDcJD4m.jpg?1)
 
Once a trail is selected from the results, it will take you to a details screen, this screen also includes the main picture, but also allows you to see other pictures that may be present. It also includes the name, rating, location, and difficulty, but it also has a button to look at reviews, and a picture of the route on a map, where the trail is highlighted and has pins for the start and end locations. This map would be intractable. There is also a checkmark button, allowing the user to start the trail. There is a plus button as well, which would allow the user to add the route to their list of routes (Primarily for quicker/easier access in the future). 
 
The design and flow of the search and route details was based on feedback from our previous research. It was noted that many people liked the designs that were being used in similar apps, and did not care for finer options, but rather quick and efficient access to the routes. The styles also conform to common designs, allowing new users to easily adapt to the design, and minimizing negative transfer feedback. 

### Challenge mode functionality

![](http://i.imgur.com/fDNv9YEm.jpg?1)

The general point system will be an attribute of the Profile of a User, with chances for a User to gain points while using the app in a variety of ways, including but not limited to:

  Logging in and tracking your progress on a trail for a uninterrupted chain of days
  Taking and then reviewing a trail on the database of User and Default Trails
  Adding your own trail, with extra points for each person who takes and positively reviews the route
  Taking a trail in Challenge Mode, which will provide basic challenges for the User to complete while using a trail, expressed through   headphones, such as “speed up”, “take detour” and time challenge modes. 
  Adding appropriate pictures to a route
  
A User will be able to view their scores, as well as set the visibility of it to Public or Private, and they will be able to compare their overall position against friends and local users, as well as see BiWeekly Leaderboards in the Social section of the app. This aspect of gamification and leaderboards is well supported by Secondary Research into similar fitness apps, such as the Fitbit line of apps and Pokemon Go, all of which rely on the measurement of personal physical accomplishments in a numerically represented way, and take advantage of the draw of making numbers go higher, and then comparing those numbers to friends numbers.

 
 
## Reflection
 
 This phase of the app design involved taking the information gathered from the user research conducted and coming up with several different ideas on how to incorporate them in the prototype. By brainstorming we were able to come up with additional ideas for how the app should look, and what more functions it can have. Each idea that was presented also served as a stepping stone from which we were able to build further possible designs. 

Once the ideas were selected, sketching them really helped us visualize if the proposed functionalities were feasible and if they would work in conjunction with the other functions we’ve outlined. Afterwards, we filtered through the sketches and selected only those we deemed to be viable designs considering the time that was available and the main functions and appearance we wanted the app to have. We then classified these sketches in to four different groups with each group containing a list of similar attributes, forming an affinity diagram. Three of the four groups were selected and divided among the team for further analysis. The feasibility, originality, strength and weakness of these ideas was then described in detail.

Since the unique design of the app is the one involving the “add route” feature, a storyboard was then created illustrating the use of that function, where one of the three methods of adding a route is selected. Based on this, a video prototype was developed depicting the app in use and incorporating all possible methods of adding a route. A task centered design walkthrough was also established around a fictional character describing the steps involved in accomplishing the task depicted in the prototype. 

In this phase of the design, the challenge was deciding which sketches to leave out of the design, which functions to group together when building the affinity diagrams, and what method to use in developing a prototype. Had there been more time, some discarded, yet feasible ideas could have been incorporated to the affinity diagrams from the sketches created, as well as a more detailed video illustrating other functions of the app.
